CS 165 - Project 3
Algorithmic Experiments of Real-World Phenomena

Project 3 involves testing various graph algorithms experimentally to determine properties of models of real-world networks. The specific graph algorithms you should implement are the following three algorithms (please see the course notes for details on these algorithms):

1. Diameter algorithm, that is, as best is reasonably possible, determine the length of a longest path in the graph.
2. Clustering-coefficient algorithm, that is, determine the ratio of three times the number of triangles over the number of paths of length 2.
3. Degree-distribution algorithm, that is, determine for each possible degree, the number of vertices in the graph with that degree.

You need to test each algorithm on Barabasi-Albert random graphs, generated with the parameter d = 5 as the number of neighbors each new vertex chooses.

You should determine the diameter and clustering coefficients of multiple random graphs of length n.
